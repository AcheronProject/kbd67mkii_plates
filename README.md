However, the original plate file __KBD67-MKII-Plate-Soldered.dxf__ was not authored by the Acheron Project but by the original designer, ai03, and as such are subject to their own licensing. These files were obtained by Gondolindrim from [ai03's public repository](http://dl.ai03.me) in June 24, 2020. For commercial use of the files, please contact ai03 directly. Even with this license, permission to use these files to design the replacement plates was given from ai03 to Gondolindrim expressly.

Commercial use of these files is licensed under the AOHL 1.3, but it would be a good idea to contact ai03 since the KBD67 is a KBDFans product.
